      <p>This is basicly a gun as you would see in the video and is almost like a real gun. For some reason the firing/shooting animations as well as the reload animations dosen't work in this video. I think it has something to do with i changing the game. Because i implemted this in a new basepalte that way i could showcase it. But i forgot about the animations not working when their now from myself as the animations are created by a group i own. But overall the scripting and gun works pretty well.</p>
